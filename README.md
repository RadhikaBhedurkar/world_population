World Population Analysis SQL Project

# Overview

This Advanced SQL Project analyzes global population growth trends using real-world-style data from 2000 to 2020.
It explores how countriesâ€™ populations have changed over two decades, calculates growth rates (CAGR), and highlights insights about global demographic shifts.

# Project Objectives

1. Store and manage population data efficiently in a relational database.

2. Calculate Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for each country.

3. Identify fastest-growing and declining populations.

4. Perform analytical queries for regional comparisons, average growth, and rankings.

5. Build a foundation for linking population with other metrics like GDP or urbanization.

# Insights

1. Nigeria shows the highest population growth in the dataset.

2. Developed nations like Japan and Germany have negative or near-zero growth.

3. Asia contributes significantly to global population increase.

4. This data can be extended to include GDP, birth rate, and urbanization for deeper analysis.
